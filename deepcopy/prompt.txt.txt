Use of AI Tools

During the project, ChatGPT was used as a technical assistant for automating repetitive setup tasks, verifying correctness, improving presentation clarity, and refining project documentation.
All AI-generated outputs were reviewed, tested, and validated manually before inclusion in the final submission.
Furthermore, all performance analysis, data interpretation, and conclusions presented in the report were performed entirely by us — the AI was used only for linguistic refinement and formatting of our own findings.

Some examples:

Automation Script Setup:
“Write a fully automated Python script that builds CPython from source, installs missing dependencies automatically (including zlib, ffi, and expat), runs the deepcopy benchmark from pyperformance, and compares baseline vs optimized versions.”

Correctness Validation:
“Create a short Python snippet that tests deep copy correctness for complex nested data structures, including self-references, to verify my optimized implementation behaves identically to the baseline.”

README and Documentation Writing:
“Rewrite my README file so it clearly explains how to run the script end-to-end, mentions the automatic dependency repair, and includes a note about pressing Enter when the package configuration dialog appears.”

Benchmark Comparison Formatting:
“Format the console output comparison between baseline and optimized runs in color-coded style (green for improvement, red for regression) with clear percentage differences.”
